Hi, I'm Rebati Gaire. I'm passionate about building efficient and novel machine learning systems, and conducting research in recent advances in computer vision. My current focus is on designing efficient models that can run on resource-constrained edge devices to help democratize access to AI. I completed my master’s degree in Computer Science at the [`School of Computing, University of Nebraska-Lincoln`](https://computing.unl.edu/) and my bachelor’s degree in Computer Engineering at Tribhuvan University, Institute of Engineering (IOE), Pulchowk Campus.

My experience spans both research and industry. I have worked on generative models, diffusion models, language vision modeling, self-supervised learning, active learning, federated learning, biomedical vision, and software hardware co-design techniques. I have also contributed to fast-paced startup environments where I built practical, production-ready systems and delivered solutions that addressed real-world needs. This combination of research depth and hands-on engineering has shaped how I approach designing reliable and efficient AI systems.

Looking ahead, I’m eager to continue exploring and advancing innovative solutions in computer vision, AI, and software engineering. I’m enthusiastic about connecting with professionals who share these interests and discussing potential collaborations. If you have any intriguing projects or opportunities for collaboration, let’s [`connect`](/contact/). I’d love to hear from you!
