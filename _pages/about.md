Hi, I’m Rebati Raman Gaire. I’m currently pursuing a master’s degree in Computer Science at the [`School of Computing, University of Nebraska-Lincoln`](https://computing.unl.edu/), where I also work as a Graduate Research Assistant. My current research focuses on advanced model compression techniques, active learning, and continual learning for edge devices.

My background includes diverse research and industry projects, where I’ve gained experience in applying various deep learning techniques to develop software solutions for practical problems. I have worked with active learning, self-supervised learning, federated learning, image segmentation, object detection, and generative models like GANs and VAEs. I completed my undergraduate studies in Computer Engineering at Tribhuvan University, Institute of Engineering (IOE), Pulchowk Campus.

Looking ahead, I’m eager to continue exploring and advancing innovative solutions in computer vision, AI, and software engineering. I’m enthusiastic about connecting with professionals who share these interests and discussing potential collaborations. If you have any intriguing projects or opportunities for collaboration, let’s [`connect`](/contact/). I’d love to hear from you!
